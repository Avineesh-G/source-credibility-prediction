```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('punkt')"
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Run the Complete Demo
```bash
python demo.py
```

#### 2. Command Line Interface

**Train a model:**
```bash
python main.py --mode train --data path/to/your/dataset.csv
```

**Make predictions:**
```bash
python main.py --mode predict --text "Your text to analyze here"
```

**Batch prediction:**
```bash
python main.py --mode predict --batch path/to/texts.txt --output results.csv
```

**Start web API:**
```bash
python main.py --mode api --host localhost --port 5000
```

#### 3. Web API Usage

After starting the API server:

**Health check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Single prediction:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "BREAKING: Scientists discover miracle cure!"}'
```

**Batch prediction:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/batch_predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"texts": ["Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3"]}'
```

#### 4. Python API Usage

```python
from src.pipeline import CredibilityPredictionPipeline
import pandas as pd

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = CredibilityPredictionPipeline()

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Prepare and train
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = pipeline.prepare_data(df)
results = pipeline.train_models(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)

# Make predictions
predictions, probabilities = pipeline.predict([
    "BREAKING: Miracle cure discovered!",
    "According to a peer-reviewed study..."
])

# Get detailed explanation
explanation = pipeline.predict_with_explanation("Your text here")
```
